I currently use Mozilla Firefox, formerly Google Chrome for browsing. I bookmark websites from the beginning. But why do I?\nCharacteristics Saving It’s typical for my browsing that I don’t like to leave many tabs open. If there is not enough information on a given tab, I will close it. If it contains useful info, I usually bookmark it. Because the number of bookmarks is growing rapidly this way (which was a problem for Chrome, for example), I regularly export (save) them to my computer. Then I have the opportunity to weed out, to refresh them. So the number of my bookmarks is growing and shrinking according to how much I find their topic worth preserving. It also happens that the topic is worth preserving, but I feel it is necessary to prune them. This is when I usually delete entire folders.\nOrganizing I organize the bookmarks into folders by topic. I recently came up with a rule that I try to stick to: don’t embed folders deeper than three levels. For example, R =\u0026gt; Plot =\u0026gt; Tools. If I feel the need to create a fourth level, I will consider moving, deleting to adhere to my principle if possible. This keeps it clearer.\nLanguages My bookmarks mostly include Hungarian and English pages. Since I organize them according to the topic, their language is irrelevant to me. For this reason, the Hungarian and English pages may be mixed within a given topic. Because I feel it is unnecessary to translate them into the other language, they are also mixed in this way on the Resources page.\nAbout two-thirds of all my bookmarks are visible within the Resources page. These are mostly related to work and my narrower area of ​​interest.\nCreating the entry When I was thinking about compiling the page, it popped to my mind to display the bookmark favicons. However, due to the difficulty of the accompanying work (especially automation), I discarded it. Instead, I use a simple multi-level unordered list. I also chose this solution because of the large number of bookmarks and their nested nature, I found it necessary to include a table of contents aside to make them more transparent.\nThe arduous process of creating the site is well illustrated by the accompanying GitHub issue Make a treeview of bookmarks in Resources menu. I will try to summarize this briefly below:\n goal: Display some of my bookmarks within the Resources page as automatically as possible. By doing so, I force myself to sort them, make them available to others, and I can link to them on my website. initial idea: I was reminded of a tree graph of the folders displayed by Windows Explorer. In English this is called a treeview. A similar effect could be achieved with the accordion element, which also forms an expandable list. It would be good to explain each bookmark: why that particular page is interesting. It would also be a good idea to display favicons next to the bookmark title. research: I searched Google for terms that included the environment (Hugo), preferred technology (HTML, CSS to make it as simple as possible) and automation. breakdown: after ruling out options due to their complexity and not finding a ready (simple) solution to the problem, I was forced to experiment with the simplest functional version. This process is also well illustrated by the two Stack Overflow posts I published on the subject: Convert Firefox bookmarks JSON file to markdown and Keep newline character in string during gsub solution: simple nested unordered list. The many bookmarks would require a table of contents. Hugo can generate this by itself from header elements, but therefore I am forced to convert folder names to appropriate level header elements. Markdown allows to combine style elements. refinement: I only wanted to keep the markers (bullet points) for certain list items, but unfortunately I don\u0026rsquo;t have the option to do so according to the current state of CSS. That\u0026rsquo;s why I removed all of it.  General considerations A good way to keep my bookmarks in check is to place a group that covers a specific topic separately within the Resources menu. This way, they get out from the bookmarks, reducing their number, yet you have the opportunity to expand them. Exploration on the topic can be continued with additional links and they can be explained. These can be seen as antecedents of posts.\nIf we look at the phenomenon from a distance, we can actually ask the following question: How can we deal with the things that come to our attention while browsing? This contains:\n saving (later access), bookmarks are appropriate for this organizing (in the light of the above, grouped or labeled so that they are clear or easy to find), bookmarks are also good for this. Especially in Firefox, because Chrome bookmarks can\u0026rsquo;t be tagged. note taking (what I was thinking when I saved it), annotating (there may be only one interesting sentence throughout the page).  Annotation tools (alternatives) try to provide solutions for the above tasks, such as:\n Memex. I tried to use this for a while but found it a bit cumbersome. This is also due to the changeover. The company’s philosophy itself is exemplary, it’s worth reading their blog. Pocket. I started using this too, but it’s not comfortable either. I haven’t dealt with exporting the data yet (but it doesn’t seem friendly).  Reviewing my bookmarks, I may be able to distinguish the following types:\n forums, e.g. Stack Overflow, Quora databases, collections, search engines, e.g. Internet Archive, Hungaricana tools, e.g. Trello, Leaflet posts, articles, e.g. Medium posts, Index articles books, e.g. Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, ELTE IK ekönyvek blogs, personal websites, e.g. Hope in Source, Yan Holtz separate pages, e.g. EU GDPR  If I look through these, I can see that there is an overlap, for example I often search on Stack Overflow as well. I can also look at them as pages on which\n no new content is generated or only a small amount, so it is easy to comprehend new content is created or discovered (in larger amounts), thus rapidly increasing the number of bookmarks.  The situation above raises these questions: is it worth categorizing and managing bookmarks under that page? Is it possible to manage them through the page to which they belong? Doesn’t it make them harder to review and harder to access if I manage them through a particular page and not through bookmarks? For example, should I organize Medium posts through Medium? Should I handle Stack Overflow questions through their site? If that was the case, I would only keep them in one place: either in the bookmarks or in the system of that page, because I don’t want to do double work. Another alternative would be to use the annotation applications mentioned above, in which the quickly generated content could be saved and managed regardless of their origin, from which only a few would be included in the bookmarks. A third alternative is to take notes on them, even on this blog and thereby process them. Then it is not necessary to save the page itself, but notes will arise and need to be maintained\u0026hellip;\nThe situation is plastic and will change in the future.\n","date":1609804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609838299,"objectID":"e9d877425036e26a51e69e153bc68cc2","permalink":"https://hermanp.github.io/en/post/about-the-bookmarks/","publishdate":"2021-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/about-the-bookmarks/","section":"post","summary":"My bookmarks is published under the Resources tab.

Showcasing a portfolio? (Bwahaha\u0026hellip; First, you have to create a portfolio.😄) I just want a simple way to make and maintain a website. Hm\u0026hellip; blogdown? Nice, I can do the whole thing in RStudio!\u0026rdquo; — or how I have fantasized about it months ago.\n Where he ask for what he can’t get, there he get what he don’t ask for.\n— Old Witch from The Treasure of Swamp Castle\n Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how I managed to get to this point and what hindrances slowed me down. This first post serves as a memo 📝 to myself and maybe a helping hand for others.\nBackground I am familiar with using RStudio and the R language. If there is a way to make and publish a website using these tools, that would be neat! Furthermore, I may want to use some R code chunks in the posts. With these possible requirements I searched and found the blogdown package. This was the starting point and through the setup I frequently reevaluated the possibilities of creating a website which are summarized in the following sections.\nStatic site generators Basically there are two types of websites: static and dynamic. The following blogdown book link 2.1 Static sites and Hugo is a good comparison. Also, there was a temptation to use a website builder, but I rejected it based on portability and (then hoped) quickstart of the whole process. Good justifications are presented in the following links (from a web search website builder cms vs hugo):\n Why I Chose Hugo Framework For My First Blog? Why I moved my personal blog from Wordpress to Hugo Jamstack - there is a new movement in website and app building which relies on static site generators, just like Hugo  I chose static because its simplicity, portability. It will suffice the needs in the near future, so why not use the simpler approach?\nBlogdown blogdown has a thorough documentation (blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown) and loads of websites were created using it (see blogdown in Resources). Some of these websites have posts, tips about the setup or links to a GitHub repo which contains the source files. This is promising! (And also exhaustive to grasp it.)\nBlogdown uses the hugo framework, a static site generator to build the website from its sources. What does that mean? Hugo allows to create the content of the website by using simple markdown syntax (and some LaTeX math and shortcodes for supplement). Based on the markdown files (.md), Hugo tries to create files readable by web browsers (this is called build). However, Hugo can not understand R markdown (.Rmd, .Rmarkdown) files, the flavor which allows R code chunks. But blogdown steps in and converts the R markdowns:\n to HTMLs. However this may lead to unwanted consequences seen in the post Changing your Blogdown Workflow (which was referenced alongside other bypass options of other blogdown users in the repo\u0026rsquo;s v0.21 wishlist #476 issue). Most of the issues have been resolved attested by this issue comment. to markdown files. Now, this can be processed by Hugo. This is an advanced option for building. To get an overview of the building options, see the blogdown book section D.9 Different building methods and to see good charts describing this, see Scientific and Technical Blogging: Radix vs. Blogdown.  Academic (Wowchemy) theme An important part of the picture is the Hugo theme. As stated in the blogdown book (section 1.7 A recommended workflow) the first task building a Hugo based site is to:\n  Carefully pick a theme at https://themes.gohugo.io\u0026hellip;   At the time of my first attempts to create the site (mid September, 2020), the blogdown book suggested the Academic theme as \u0026ldquo;strongly recommended for users in academia\u0026rdquo; see the history of the relevant book chapter and particularly this pull request. I wanted my site to be bilingual, Academic supported this, so I have chosen it. In the meantime, Academic have gone through a rebranding and became Wowchemy and adapted a Hugo modules structure. This ought to be adapted by blogdown and somehow the maintainer, Yihui Xie, managed it. But the hindrances made them to remove Academic as a recommended theme. Still, why do I stick with it? Mainly because:\n popularity, which means higher chance to get help if needed active maintenance, which means updates and new features simple, yet functional design, which allows different kind of contents (introduction page, blogpost, book chapter)  I almost throw it out and will do it if it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. The above illustrates how important is to keep up with the changes. Sometimes these changes break code and sometimes the dependency hell messes up. This leads to the actual setup process.\nSetup and usage Basic setup I read almost the entire blogdown book and done the setup according to it. However, the first obstacle showed up, as documented in this Stack Overflow post by me.\nThe main problem was the need to install Go to use blogdown with Academic Hugo theme (in RStudio, but I suppose this was the case without RStudio). This was due to the theme\u0026rsquo;s transition to Hugo module system. As I highlighted in the question, this was a shock for me, because \u0026ldquo;Unlike other static site generators, the installation of Hugo is very simple because it provides a single executable without dependencies for most operating systems.\u0026quot; — as we can read in the blogdown book section 2.1 Static sites and Hugo. My problem contradicted one of the main advantages of Hugo! Thanks to Yihui Xie, the maintainer of the blogdown package, it was resolved in the commit da068a7 (where he expresses his dismay about the situation also). This commit was part of blogdown release version 0.21 (\u0026ldquo;If a theme contains Hugo modules (e.g., the former hugo-academic theme), the modules will be resolved at the time when a theme is installed, which means users will not need to install Go or GIT to work with themes that contain Hugo modules.\u0026quot;). Note: if you follow the installation documentation of the theme, it states to install Go (and other software).\nAfter the software environment was set up, I followed along the theme docs: Getting started. I wanted to get rid of most of the widgets (only keep the experience widget) on my home page. As the docs offer:\n Then, open your content/home/ folder and set the active parameter to either true or false for each widget depending on if you wish to display it or not. Widgets that you don’t need can alternatively be deleted rather than setting active to false.\n So I deleted them. But somehow I could not get rid of this homepage screen:\nSo after some foul language and reinstall I decided to keep all the widget files and set their active parameter to false in the front matter. And lo and behold, it was working. (By the way, this picture wasn\u0026rsquo;t saved previously, but rather found with Google image search: \u0026lsquo;hugo academic widget\u0026rsquo; ➕ Tools ➡️ Color ➡️ green)\nWhat have I done beside the setup?\n set the avatar (picture on home screen and after content), see Wowchemy docs: Getting started website icon, Wowchemy docs: Customization color themes, Wowchemy docs: Customization menus (en/hu), Wowchemy docs: Language and translation widget spacing, Add option to customize homepage section spacing? #433 settings (all in config/_default/params.toml)  no map no contact widget no comment    Bilingual setup Problems arose with my supposed bilingual setup also. The most heavy was documented in a Stack Overflow post by me. When I tried to use the blogdown addin \u0026ldquo;New Post\u0026rdquo;, the addin created, but did not load the new file. It was resolved by Yihui\u0026rsquo;s commit in the blogdown repo. See the blogdown section in the Resources menu to find descriptions about multilingual setup.\nThere are two part of the setup: content and interface translation.\nContent translation Content translation can be managed by two ways: by filenames and by directory (Hugo Multilingual Part 1: Content translation). I chose the directory way, because I wanted to leverage page bundles by Hugo. I created (mirrored) the Hungarian content folder (content/hu/) according to the English one (content/en/) and modified the files.\n How to edit what I can see in a browser tab? This is the \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; element in an HTML file. This can be edited by the markdown file\u0026rsquo;s title parameter in the YAML header. The title on the homepage is set in the config.toml file\u0026rsquo;s title parameter. But how can I then set another title for my Hungarian home page? Maybe in config/_default/languages.toml? Worth a try. And voilá, it works. (See the files in my GitHub repo website.) See the copyright translation point below for parameter redefining possibilities. How to show Hungarian slug in a Hungarian post\u0026rsquo;s URL? I wanted to create the first bilingual contents and link them (called translation linking). If a linking is in effect, the language switcher is visible. To make the Hungarian post\u0026rsquo;s URL have a Hungarian slug, without accents (or without diacritic), the slug parameter can be set accordingly. Important for linking: \u0026ldquo;By having the same path and basename (relative to their language content directory), the content pieces are linked together as translated pages\u0026rdquo;.  Interface translation I would name two part of this task: string localization and footer translation.\nString localization is as easy as placing the particular language pack\u0026rsquo;s internationalization (abbreviated as i18n, due to the 18 letters between the first and last letter) file in the i18n directory inside the project root. See Hugo Multilingual Part 2: Strings localization and Wowchemy documentation Language and translation. My original problem was to translate the light/dark/automatic theme names, which was resolved by the suggestion in this Wowchemy discussion Light/Dark/Automatic translation #1891. I needed to find, then copy the original Hungarian i18n file hu.yaml to the root i18n directory, then update it according to the English en.yaml file.\nFooter translation is discussed in this section, due to its separation from content. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit trickier than i18n files, as it includes work with partials. Long story short: copy a partial’s HTML file (.html) from its theme\u0026rsquo;s themes/\u0026lt;THEME\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/ folder into the site root\u0026rsquo;s layouts/partials/ folder for further customization (and overriding the original). See Partial Templates and Wowchemy docs Customization. My original problem was to translate the footer copyright and credit text.\n copyright translation: I set copyright parameter in config.toml to empty, only use the Creative Commons option. This option has a string parameter in it, which need to be translated. However, this option reside in params.toml originally. How can I add the translation and have a meaningful organization of the language dependent options? This was solved with the aid of this comment on a multilingual issue from 2016 (!) in the Wowchemy repo. In short: \u0026ldquo;It seems that Hugo allows you to put both the core Hugo variables like title = \u0026quot;My blog\u0026quot; and the Academic [params] variables (like name = \u0026quot;My name in Russian\u0026quot;) under the [languages.X] configuration section.\u0026quot; credit translation: I wanted to translate the Wowchemy credit in the footer, which can be done via an if-else clause in the site_footer.html file. This Wowchemy discussion How can I add credits by the end of the page? #1886 answered it by showing an example. copyright icons: the Creative Commons icons weblinks seemed to be broken, therefore not showing. I needed to update them in the site_footer_license.html file.  Usage Automatic deployment After you write your content and want to publish it, you need to build the site from its source files. This will generate a /public folder in the root folder. Then you have to copy these files in a directory of your website at a hosting service. This can be tedious and folks before me tried to get over it by automation with:\n shell scripts (Deploying a hugo-based website on GitHub user pages | Marina Varfolomeeva and Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub Pages | Amber Thomas) external continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) services (outside of GitHub), some of them being a host also (like Netlify). For example Hugo on GitHub Pages using Travis-CI for deployment or see the blogdown book\u0026rsquo;s 3. Deployment chapter for elaborate discussion on the topic.  Not so long ago GitHub Actions were born and everything became possible inside GitHub. GitHub Actions is a built in CI/CD service in GitHub, therefore everything can be done inside GitHub. Based on the following posts were I capable to do the automatic deployment of my site:\n Automate Deployment of Wowchemy Website onto GitHub Pages Getting Started With Hugo Academic and Github Pages Automatically Deploying a Hugo Website via GitHub Actions Hugo: Deploy Static Site using GitHub Actions  Note: I heard of forestry.io which makes it possible to edit the source files online and commit from there. A command line interface free option to manage the site.\nCurrent workflow  Open the (git versioned) website project in RStudio. Create a new post using the \u0026ldquo;New Post\u0026rdquo; addin. Write content. Commit the changes. Push the changes to GitHub source repository. Let GitHub Actions do its job: build the website and deploy its public folder in the GitHub Pages repository.  Managing the site I try to manage my work using the repo\u0026rsquo;s Projects page. This is a Trello like board, where tasks can be tracked. If something pops in my mind, I create a Note about it in the To Do list. If it amounts to be a task on its own, then I convert it to an Issue. If I start to work on an Issue or Note (with the aim to close it), I move it to the In Progress list. The open Issues can be automatically closed by a git push, according to the documentation.\nLessons learned I see two strategies, but they do not exclude each other:\n careful documentation reading and slow, steady work: sometimes you NEED to read it do everything as fast as possible and if problems arise, new iteration starts (sometimes with a reinstall): do not hesitate long, make the most out of your valuable time  Do not stress yourself if you do not catch up to the speed others say of the setup time. Heck, there are many posts about the failures during setup! If you are lucky, you won\u0026rsquo;t get stuck in the swamp. But luck is on those side who strive for it. 😉\n","date":1605484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609804800,"objectID":"5bdaf345d850b831bdd836b12afaa46f","permalink":"https://hermanp.github.io/en/post/how-this-blogdown-site-was-created/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/how-this-blogdown-site-was-created/","section":"post","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Maybe I should create a website or blog.
